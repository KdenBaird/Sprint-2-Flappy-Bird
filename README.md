# Overview

As a current Software Engineering major I aspire to familiarize myself with different languages, and understand certain concepts such as object-oriented programming, threading, and data structures and algorithms.

The game that I wrote is a flappy bird game. The game won't begin until the user presses the left mouse click button. This is when the pipes start to move as well as the ground, and the bird is able to fly.

The reason that I wrote this software is because I have never wrote anything using Python's pygame, and I wanted to become more familiar with it.

# Development Environment

The tools that I used to create this software was Visual Studio Code.

The programming language that I used was Python and I used the pygame library. Additional libraries that I used include: pygame.locals, pygame.font, pygame.image, pygame.sprite, pygame.display, pygame.time, pygame.draw, pygame.event, and random.

# Useful Websites

A couple websites that assisted me in this project were

- [Pygame Newbie Guide](https://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/newbieguide.html)
  (This website helped me understand pygame better.)
- [Flappy Bird PNG Images](https://www.pngwing.com/en/search?q=flappy+Bird)
  (This website allowed me to download the sprite that I used for the bird in the game.)

# Future Work

- The first thing that I need to imporve in this project is adding functionality to allow the user to click a button to start the game, as well as restart the game.
- Another thing that I would like to add is the ability save the user's highest score.
- The last thing that I might potentially add would be the ability for the user to choose different levels which might include different backgrounds, or things they're dodging as well as the ability for them to select different sprites.
